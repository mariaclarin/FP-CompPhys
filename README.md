# Optimochrone
Optimochrone is a brachistochrone graph visualizer and simulator that enhances the currently available simulators for the brachisochrone problem by providing better user interactivity, customizability, and overall beginner friendly UI/UX. Optimochrone aims to help users get deeper understanding of the brachistochrone concept and the 4 individual curves; linear, parabolic, cycloid, and circular.
